# Hello, I'm [Avneet Singh](https://avneets.me)

I'm a Software Engineer working in industry. I'm passionate about delving into the intricacies of low-level programming and system security, continually aiming to understand how things work behind the scenes.

Currently, I'm devoting my efforts towards building a Rust CLI Tool, [gitpeek](https://github.com/avneetsingh36/gitpeek).

I'm always interested in expanding my knowledge and taking on new, exciting projects. I believe in the power of shared knowledge and collaboration, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any ideas, questions, or simply want to connect.
