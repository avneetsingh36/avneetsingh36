# Hello, I'm [Avneet Singh](https://avneets.me)

I'm a Software Engineer working in industry. I'm passionate about delving into the intricacies of low-level programming and system security, continually aiming to understand how things work behind the scenes.

Currently, I'm devoting my efforts towards building a personal assistant tool, [KaizenOS](https://github.com/avneetsingh36/kaizenOS).
